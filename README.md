# Another-Quick-Qiskit-intro-for-my-Alma-Mater
Creating a Quantum Circuit to generate a bell state! 

We go over important Import statements. 

Creating a vanilla Quantum Circuit. 

Implementing Gates to effect our qubits.

Drawing our circuits to see how they look and help us troubleshoot. 

How to take measurements, and how to take many measurements to plot and hsitrogram of results! 

### For-Practice 

1) Make circuits for the other bell states, what do they have in common? Plot histograms for each. 
2) Can you be clever and make Python functions that can generate these circuits in one line? 
3) Investigate entropy! use the following import statment ' from qiskit.quantum_information import DensityMatrix, partial_trace, entropy ' , you now can use these functions!
4) Use the new imports to study the entropy of the density matrix of the system, and the entropy of the partial traces of the density matrices. Are these the results you expect?

# The practice is hard, the last part is going to require to research Qiskit documentation, and to struggle a bit and learn something! Good luck and have fun.
